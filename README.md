# Laptop-Repair-Application-System
Description: In a country with huge population such as India,
the below par quality of customer service or post purchase service is a concerning
hassle. Usually there is a huge waiting line at customer centers of laptop
companies. Companies not providing on-site repair tend to take the laptops and
inform the distressed customer with unrealistic repair duration without diagnosis.
Many times this leads to returning of the customer to the center just to find out their
laptop hasn¿t been fixed. Therefore, a need for an online portal where one can just
request for a pickup of the broken laptop, which will then be delivered to the
respective service center. The engineer will properly check the faults and update
the diagnosis along with its cost. Only when the customer approves of the repair
details can the engineer start the process and update the tentative date. The 3rd
party collects the laptop on customer¿s behalf and delivers it to the desired
location. There is also a full hardware scan of the laptop incase the engineer
purposely changes the initial configuration of the laptop.
